#+TITLE:Why I Think Glyphs Don't Improve Programming Languages

Array-based programming languages like APL and BQN have a long-standing tradition of using glyphs to represent operations, which can be traced back to APL. In this short post I'll go over why I think it might not be beneficial to have glyphs, and might actually be detrimental to the languages.
* What are Glyphs?
* Why do Array-based Languages use so many Glyphs?
* Why I think that they are not useful
* Why I think that they might be detrimental to the language
* Potential benefits to using glyphs?
* Closing thoughts
